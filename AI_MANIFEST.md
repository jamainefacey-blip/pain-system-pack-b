# PAIN SYSTEM — AI LAB BUILD MANIFEST (Backyard/core)
Version: 0.1
Owner: Jamaine Facey (Founder)
Branch scope: Backyard/core (private build zone)

## 0) Non-negotiables (locks)
- No public changes (main / production) without Roundtable approval + logged decision.
- No claims on the public site that we cannot prove in a demo.
- Security and IP protection are default; shortcuts require explicit Founder sign-off.
- Accessibility-first is mandatory across all UI and content.

## 1) Site zones (what they are)
A) Spine (Public)
- Purpose: marketing + trust + intake + clear product catalogue.
- Rule: only shows what is live or demonstrably in progress.

B) Hangar (Subscriber-only)
- Purpose: idea-to-build space, community commentary, progress updates, optional tips/recognition.
- Rule: projects can be Active/In Discussion/Partnered/Licensed/Sold-Archived/Case Study.
- Rule: progress % is indicator/self-reported/automated, not a promise.

C) Showroom (Curated, admin-approved)
- Purpose: deployable/proven items, interactive demos, “Originally from Hangar” badge.
- Rule: promotion requires Ready/Live + admin approval.

D) Backyard (Private build zone)
- Purpose: Founder + AI Lab workshop for unfinished projects, experiments, internal tooling, staging.
- Rule: items may also exist in Hangar/Showroom, but Backyard is the editable source during build.

## 2) Project movement rules (Backyard ↔ Hangar ↔ Showroom)
- Idea → Blueprint → Framework must exist for any project (minimal snapshot).
- If Founder “gets bored”: project can be parked in Hangar as Framework-ready.
- If a public Hangar project needs Founder edits: it can be “pulled into Backyard” for work,
  while still visible publicly with honest status + changelog notes.
- Showroom promotion only after Ready/Live checks pass.

## 3) What the AI Lab is allowed to build now (Backyard/core)
Priority 1 — Website foundation
- Clear navigation and content replacing placeholders (“Website Name”, “Title”, “Description”).
- Pages: Home, Projects, Accessibility, About, Services, Contact, Legal.
- Projects page must reflect Live / In Build / Concept exactly.

Priority 2 — Back office starter (internal only)
- Admin guardrails (auth, role gates, logging hooks).
- Internal “Backyard dashboard” for Founder: list projects, status, notes, links.

Priority 3 — Hangar/Showroom scaffolding (no marketplace money flow yet)
- Subscriber-only Hangar shell with:
  - up to 5 active ideas per subscriber
  - progress %, stage badge, comment support, recognition/tips language
- Showroom curated list shell with admin approval gate.

## 4) What the AI Lab must NOT do (without Roundtable)
- Payments, subscriptions, marketplace fees, equity/partnership execution on-platform.
- Public claims about compliance/certification/guarantees.
- Any irreversible architecture changes, vendor lock-in, or deleting history/logs.
- Changing domain strategy (default: thepainsystem.com).

## 5) Public wording rules (trust + compliance)
- Use: “AI-generated reference ranges (non-binding, not advice)” for valuation.
- Use: “optional tips/recognition” (not “rewards”).
- State: “Showroom demos are demonstrations; deployment/compliance is user responsibility.”
- State: “Off-platform partnership discussions are independent.”

## 6) Logging rules (decision tape)
- Every material change requires:
  - Roundtable entry (who/why/impact)
  - Version bump note
  - Changelog line
- No silent changes.

## 7) Crown assets protection
- Default retain: core frameworks, templates, governance, delivery spine, and internal tooling.
- Any sale/licence must satisfy the 3% Continuity Rule (structural differentiation retained).

END.
