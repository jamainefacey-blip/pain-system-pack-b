Ownership

	All code and system components for both placeholder UI and functional areas have been developed by Gabriel Kadiwa. The system is structured for AI-assisted development, allowing pages and components to be edited in any way required—copying, pasting, uploading project files, etc.

Site Administrators

	Can edit the data source directly from the website.

	All changes made via the admin portal will update the code and reflect for frontend users.

Frontend Users

	Cannot access the backend areas (Admin, Portal, Projects Builder).

Only administrators with credentials set in the .env file have access to these protected sections.

Deployment

	Site deployment is managed by internal developers.

	For setup, installation, and deployment instructions, refer to RUNBOOK.md.
